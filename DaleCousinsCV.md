## Professional Summary

Experienced technology leader with 15+ years’ experience in infrastructure-as-code services delivered via on-premises, cloud-based and SAAS solutions in both government and enterprise environments.My strengths lie in seeing beyond technical solutions, understanding why, as well as how.
My background has covered developing, delivering, and securing enterprise solutions. Through my varied roles I’ve experienced being a service provider, as well as an end-user. I’ve led and mentored engineers and architects, created, and optimised, service-delivery processes, and also managed regulatory compliance.
I’m highly creative and have a love of innovative technologies. I’m keen to turn my attention to blockchain solutions in order to play a role in the large-scale adoption of secure, decentralised applications and platforms.

## Key Achievements
 - Led a project to decommission insecure TLS versions across ~1500 internet-facing services, paving the way for TLS 1.3 adoption within the organisation.
 - Sponsored a number of programs to remove long-standing critical risks from the network perimeter. 
 - Introduced zero-touch switch provisioning within data centres, reducing leaf deployment time from ~2 days to a few hours.
 - Developed a software-defined networking pipeline to manage complex configurations within data-centre switching fabrics.
 - Built a mission-critical service delivery team from scratch with two engineers - this team has now scaled up to fifteen full-time resources, servicing over 2,500 requests per year.
