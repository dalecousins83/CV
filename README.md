## Professional Summary

Strategic technology leader with 15+ years of experience designing, securing, and delivering infrastructure-as-code solutions across cloud, SaaS, and on-prem environments in government and enterprise sectors.
Strong ability to align technical strategy with business goals, bringing a dual perspective from background as both a service-provider and end-user, enabling me to build scalable, human-centered systems. I’ve led high-performing teams, mentored engineers & architects, and driven process optimisation, compliance, and innovation at scale.
Seeking to utilise my strengths in new areas, leveraging deep problem-solving ability, creativity, and leadership to drive transformation and create meaningful impact.

## Key Achievements
 - Led a project to decommission insecure TLS versions across ~1500 internet-facing services, paving the way for TLS 1.3 adoption and a stronger security posture.
 - Automated Secure Internet Gateway services (firewall, WAF, web-proxy, etc.) for a large government organisation, reducing operational overhead and improving service request fulfilment time.
 - Sponsored and delivered a number of programs to remove long-standing critical risks from the network perimeter, significantly improving security posture. 
 - Introduced zero-touch switch provisioning within data centres, reducing leaf deployment time from ~2 days to a few hours, significantly improving infrastructure scalability.
 - Designed and built a software-defined networking pipeline to manage complex configurations within data-centre switching fabrics, reducing manual errors and deployment time.
 - Built a high-performing service delivery team from the ground up, scaling from 2 to 15 engineers and supporting over 3,000 service requests annually with high customer satisfaction.
